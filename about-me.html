            <h1>Hi there! My name is Andrea and welcome to my learning journal.</h1>
            <p>After several months of learning in the Frontend Developer Career Path, I've made
            the big jump over to the Bootcamp to get expert code reviews of my Solo Projects
             projects and meet like-minded peers.</p>

            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p> I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and 
                hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or 
                work new techniques into existing projects. 
            </p>
            <p>While that was fun, I felt like 
                it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my 
                journey with the world.
            </p> 
                
            <h3>How I got started</h3>
                
            <p>I started simple and gradually grew my learning journal site. I would take 
                notes about what I was learning. After each learning session, I'd use my 
                notes to not only reflect on what I learned but also write short summaries
                 of what I learned using my own words.
            </p>
            <p>That helped me grow what I was learning, and I realized that posting my 
                learning summaries was also helping others learn and stay motivated.
            </p>
